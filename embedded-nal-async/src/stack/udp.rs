//! Traits for using UDP on embedded devices
//!
//! ## Notes for implementers
//!
//! * At several places, the APIs expect to provide a local address. Backends that can not obtain
//!   it, such as some AT-command based stacks, <!-- should question whether they may really call
//!   themselves UDP and --> may pretend to have performed some form of network address
//!   translation, and present invalid addresses as the local address.
//!
//! * Implementing [`UdpStack::UniquelyBound`] and [`UdpStack::MultiplyBound`] unconnected sockets
//!   separately allows discarding the local addresses in the bound case. With LTO enabled, all the
//!   overhead compared with a third trait variant between [ConnectedUdp] and [UnconnectedUdp] (in
//!   which the local address is static but the remote address is flexible) should optimized out.
//!   Implementing `UniquelyBound` and `MultiplyBound` with the same type is expected to be a
//!   common choice.

/// connected (has a remote IP address and port).
///
/// The term "connected" here refers to the semantics of POSIX datagram sockets, through which datagrams
/// are sent and received without having a remote address per call. It does not imply any process
/// of establishing a connection (which is absent in UDP). While there is typically no POSIX
/// `bind()` call in the creation of such sockets, these are implicitly bound to a suitable local
/// address at connect time.

	///
